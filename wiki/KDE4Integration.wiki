Making Arora fit better in KDE4

= Introduction =

As it is today Arora doesn't fit as well as it could into KDE4.  Below is a list of ideas on ways to improve that

== Details ==

The following should already happen
  * Use the Oxygen style
  * Use KDE shortcuts
  * Use KDE icons (given by the shortcut)
  * Desktop file should appear in the KDE menu
  * Import Konq's bookmarks (Both applications use XBel format)

== TODO ==

In Oxygen
  * Oxygen needs to overload standardIconImplementation and return the  KDE icons for the back/forward/stop/reload and other icons so Arora  will get them rather then the standard ones oxygen is giving today.
  * Oxygen needs to add support several new QTabBar style hints that  were added in 4.5 http://labs.trolltech.com/blogs/2008/07/02/some-qtabbar-qtabwidget-love/
  * Check to see if Oxygen has rendering issues in qtwebkit (line edits or buttons)?  It did in the past.
  * Does oxygen cause the KDE file dialog to be used?

In Arora
  * Use the new proxy stuff in 4.5 which in theory will pickup KDE's  proxy setting in the future.
  * Don't use activate in the bookmark manager/cookie manager (Need to  test in kde)
