#summary The Unsorted drop zone

= Introduction =

This is short term dumping ground for bugs, tasks, ideas, and suggestions, the TODO file from before the project was hosted on Google.

=== QtWebKit Issues ===
  * Find, hit enter, link isn't followed
  * In statusbar: "Loading "url", completed 66 of 74 items"
  * [205030] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_economics assert on OS X
 
=== Qt Issues ===
  * right click on the left side of the toolbar the menu should be empty, but it shows the menu for the first item

=== general ===
  * QMenu with no parent for OS X
  * view source in right click menu
  * Enable the page cache in QtWebKit (see QWebSettings for that), a simple calculation like having 10 tabs with forward and back should work fast you are at 20 pages.

Misc (maybe or nice to have or investigate later)
  * Download file ends with .download an then renamed?

=== Extensions ===
  * KWallet integration
  * Set the user agent
  * GreaseMonkey
