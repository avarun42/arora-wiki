URL bar:

  * Search by any part of the URL. For example, if I had previously visited http://www.linux.org.ru/view-all.jsp, I expect it to come up when searching for “lin” or “view”.
  * Better cooperation with faulty themes. The bar shouldn’t go all black just because the QtCurve and GTK themes draw gradients incorrectly.

Bookmarks:
  * One-click bookmarking ("star") - just add it directly to the menu, or to a subfolder, not to “Uncategorized” like in Firefox 3

General:
  * Improved scrolling and textarea typing performance - probably a problem with webkit in general, since the GTK version suffers from this as well
  * Ad blocker
  * Per-site configuration for enabling JavaScript, plugins and images
  * Autocomplete
